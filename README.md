Ableton Swap Meet - One man's garbage is another man's garbage with good side chain effects

## Description
This repository is for the creators of original Ableton Live assets (Sets, Clips, Presets)
with the goal of collaboration and learning. 

If you use any of these assets in your own original work please ensure that it is acceptable
under the license of this repo and, honestly not like anyone's going to steal anything, but
because you never know lets just say it - don't use anyone's content without their permission
or steal or punch kittens. This is just for fun.

## Tips for sharing efficacy

Not everyone owns the same VSTs as you do, so if you upload a project that fails to load
correctly you're going to make it more difficult for someone to listen to and remix your
project.

You can use this table as a reference for what folks have access to depending on their
Ableton license. When a device is available for Intro, Standard, and Suite it is ommited
from this list to save space. It's reasonable to target your projects towards any level
of license - but the higher you go the less people will be able to use it.
