# HOLY SCALES! By 8 Bit Bandit

## How to install: 

Drag the folder into Places on the left hand side of Ableton or you can load each preset and save one by one into your own library. 

## How to use: 

Find your desired song key in which you want to lock into. Load it and play. While playing or automating, turn the chain macro knobs to change the chords in the note your hitting while staying locked in the key you load. 

## Notes:

Each preset is labeled with three different DJ software key read outs then ending 
with the classic scale for conversion purposes. All the chords are labeled so you 
can easily tell any anyone else what key and chord progression your playing in. 

Also each program detects key differently, results can vary as you change tonality 
in synths, note & chord progressions or even kick pitch. Please enjoy and expand 
with this usful midi chain.
